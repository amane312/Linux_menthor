$ for file in *.png; do convert $file -resize 300x150 thumbnail-$file; done 
```

```bash
# size: 300x150 (It will ignore the aspect ratio of the source image and
# resize it 300 pixels in width and 150 pixels in height.)
$ for file in *.png; do convert $file -resize 300x150 thumbnail-$file; done 
```

```bash
# set width to 300 pixels
$ for file in *.png; do convert $file -resize 300 thumbnail-$file; done 
```

```bash
# set height to 150 pixels
$ for file in *.png; do convert $file -resize x150 thumbnail-$file; done
